## Introduction

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) email-based authentication application using [Altogic](https://www.altogic.com), backend-as-a-service platform as the backend using its client library.

This authentication method requires users to specify their email and passwords. After signing up, users can log in to the application using their email and password.

By default email verification is enabled in your App settings â†’ Authentication view of Designer. If you would like to change this, you can disable "Confirm email addresses" in the Authentication view of Designer.

You can find the written tutorial of this demo app on [our Medium blog.](https://medium.com/altogic/altogic-email-authentication-with-next-js-and-altogic-4c036c36ea8f)

### What is the email authentication flow inÂ Altogic?

1. Users sign up with their email and password.
2. A verification email is sent to the specified email address by Altogic.
3. Users confirm their email by clicking on the link in the sent email.
4. Altogic checks the token in clicked link and if valid changes the user's email address to verified and returns an access token in the query string parameter of the redirect URL.
5. This access token is used to get a session token and users are directed to their profile page.

## Installation

### Creating App in Altogic

We can create an app with the Altogic Designer really fast. To create an app via the Designer:

1. Log in to Altogic with your credentials.
2. Select New app.
3. In the App name field, enter a name for the app.
4. And click create.

We need `envUrl` and `clientKey` to access our environment via Altogic Client Library. `envUrl` is specific to each environment, and Altogic initially creates one environment for you when you create your app. To get the `envUrl` via the Designer:

1. Launch the Designer.
2. Click/tap on Environments at the left-bottom of the designer.
3. Click/tap name of the Environment
4. Scroll down to API BASE URL section.
5. Copy subdomain or environment url.

We can get the `clientKey` by clicking on the App Settings button in the left-bottom corner of the Designer and clicking on the Client library keys section.

Now you have got both `clientKey`and `envUrl`. Now you have to create a `.env.local` file in your root directory of the project to complete the Altogic configuration with your app:

```bash
touch .env.local
```

Copy and paste the below code to your `.env.local` file, don't forget to change <YOUR-APPLICATION-ENV-URL> and <YOUR-APPLICATION-CLIENT-KEY> values with your `envUrl` and `clientKey`.

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALTOGIC_ENV_URL = <YOUR-APPLICATION-ENV-URL>;
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALTOGIC_CLIENT_KEY = <YOUR-APPLICATION-CLIENT-KEY>;
```
